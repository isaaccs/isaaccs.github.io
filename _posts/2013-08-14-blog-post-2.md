Image recognition is one of the most important deep learning topics today.
We find it in medicine, in Automobile Industry, on Social Networks even on our phones.
The problem whit Image Recognition, is that it requires a lot of resources and a lot of data.
For example, if tomorrow you decide to create an app to differentiate a dog from a man or identify the breed of a dog, if you have few data and few resources this may be difficult.
Thatâ€™s why we use Transfer Learning.
