About me 
======


I am currently working at PacketAI as a Machine Learning Engineer. 
I use Deep Learning methods for monitoring IT system by analysis logs and metrics. Also, I work on a scalable parsing method for logs by using embedding technics.

Previously, I was a PhD student at LPSM and at Pacifica (CAA) under the supervision of Olivier Lopez (LPSM).
During my PhD thesis, I combined Machine Learning algorithms with survival analysis and Extreme Values Theory for improving the outcome of insurance claims.
