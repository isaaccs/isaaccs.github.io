title: "Method for automatically detecting anomalies in log files."
collection: Patent 21306110.4
permalink: /publication/2021-08-10-patent-1
excerpt: 'The present invention relates to a method for monitoring log files related to the operation of one or more components, such as applications, services, sensors, or instruments. 
Modern software systems, such as an application executed on a computer, can generate log files comprising several messages that may be used to troubleshoot the program. Messages comprised in log files can be unstructured free-form text strings, which can record events or states of interest and capture the intent of the developer. These logs files can be read by a developer or a user to detect the events, states, and other interesting occurrences. Usually, when the execution of a program fails, for example when it does not perform according to expectations, system operators can examine recorded log files to obtain insights about the failure and find out the potential root causes.
The present invention relates to a method for automatically detecting anomalies in one or more log files by using a neural network trained beforehand. The invention also relates to a system for implementing such method. Finally, the invention relates to a method for training the neural network used in the method for automatically detecting anomalies in one or more log files.
